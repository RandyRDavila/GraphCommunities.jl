# Welcome to GraphCommunities.jl

`GraphCommunities.jl` is a Julia package that implements community detection algorithms on `AbstractGraph` types from `Graphs.jl` and `SimpleWeightedGraphs.jl`. It employs various community detection algorithms and also provides functionality for generating graphs with community structure. Currently, the package includes the following community detection algorithms:

1. The Louvain Algorithm
2. The K-Clique Percolation Algorithm with `K = 3`
3. The Label Propagation Algorithm

`GraphCommunities.jl` is designed to work seamlessly with the `Graphs.jl` package. All the graph structures, types, and utilities provided by `Graphs.jl` are the foundation of our package. This ensures compatibility, performance, and a familiar API for those already acquainted with `Graphs.jl`.

If you're new to Graphs.jl, it's recommended to check out their [documentation](https://github.com/JuliaGraphs/Graphs.jl) to get a deeper understanding of the graph structures and operations you can leverage.

Finally, `GraphCommunities.jl` also has built in functionality for generating graphs with community like structure.

## Installation

To add the `GraphCommunities` package to your Julia environment, you can use the Julia package manager. In the Julia REPL, enter the package manager by pressing `]`, then run:

```julia
(@v1.x) pkg> add https://github.com/RandyRDavila/GraphCommunities.jl.git
```

After the package is added, you can use it in your Julia sessions with:

```julia
using GraphCommunities
```
